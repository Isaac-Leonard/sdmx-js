SDMX-JS

I was hoping to make an SDMX viewer similar to SDMX-SAX-Faces, but i cannot find a decent typescript widget library with templates
to implement it...

so i think i will wait for some new ecma script 6 libraries to come out to use with this library...
please feel free to steal the name 'sdmx-js' =D
